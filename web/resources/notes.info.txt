create something you need...
what can you implement from a real world experience...
you care about your time maybe a pomodera timer?
you like being organized perhaps a appending todo list?
you like being motivated maybe a impersional quote generator? - yes
you want a job as a software enginner create a portfolio?
you have trouble with css grid create a tic tac toe game?
you want to be fit why not build something to track work outs

you dont have to have all the answers now.
its ok so ask your community for help.
